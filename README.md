**What Is the Coin Master Team Castle Event?**

The Team Castle event is a special in-game feature in *Coin Master*, where players team up to contribute to building a castle. These castles can be created using a variety of materials, including cards, spins, and other resources that are earned throughout gameplay.

**How the Team Castle Event Works:**

The basic premise of the Team Castle event is simple. Players are grouped into teams and must collaborate to build a castle. However, there's much more involved in terms of strategy, communication, and understanding the event costs.

1. **Team Formation**: Players are randomly assigned to a team, or they can join an existing team they’re a part of.
2. **Building Process**: Every player contributes to building the castle by contributing cards, spins, or other in-game resources. The cost to build a castle varies depending on the specific event, but each castle typically requires numerous contributions.
3. **Castle Completion**: Once all the necessary contributions have been made, the team that finishes the castle is rewarded with free spins, cards, and other bonuses.
4. **Event Duration**: The event usually lasts for a set period, during which players must build as much of the castle as possible. Teams can earn additional rewards if they finish ahead of other teams or if they meet certain milestones during the event.
